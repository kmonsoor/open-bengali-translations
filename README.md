Open Bengali Translations
=========================

Welcome to a initiative to enable software developers to support Bengali language in their software. That will highly empower the native Bengali people to usher their computing capability

Background
----------
As a Bangali, it is quite painful for me that most software support multitude of languages, but except Bengali, which is spoken by more than 250 million people.

IMO, main reasons for these scenerio are:
 - apathy of Bangladeshi government
 - lack of Bangladeshi developers in international community
 - Non-availability of hi-speed Internet to mass Bangali people
 - lack of usage of legally licensed software among mass Bangali people
 - 
 
In this context, the objective of this repository will be enable the software-dev community to easily integrate and support Bengali.

This repository will be used to store, revise, update, and stream translated from different languages to Bengali (বাংলা / Bangla) strings or vice-versa.

These text strings can to be used freely (under the MIT license) in free or open-source or closed-source commercial software.

If a closed-source software use these translations to develop translation of their software to Bengali (বাংলা / Bangla), they are:

Required to
----------------
 - Give the credits(attributions) back to this repository that will be easily reachable and viewable in the software
 - and this copyright notice that will be easily reachable and viewable in/through the software

Encouraged to but not required to
--------------------------------------------
 - share back the string(s) that will be translated / added for that software and from/into Bengali
